## Interview Study

### Data Analysis Process

For open coding, two of the authors of the paper independently read the transcripts line by line and identified concepts - _key ideas contained in data_. When looking for concepts, we searched for the best phrase that describes conceptually what we believe is indicated by the raw data. On a weekly basis, all the authors met to discuss the identified concepts and to refine and merge them if needed. That was done using card sorting: each card represented a quote labeled with the concepts, and we grouped the quotes and refined the concepts, as needed.

### All the Identified Categories

As qualitative analysis seeks to find significant concepts and explore their relationships, we only considered concepts that capture ideas mentioned by at least three study participants, excluding from the final report 18 quotes belonging to 14 concepts. [Here]() is the list of all the categories we identified in interviews. 


### Mapping Concepts to Quotes

Conceptually similar codes were grouped together to form categories. Our mapping of concepts -> subcategories -> categories is below.

## Survey Study


### Survey Form
The survey consisted of eight groups of questions and a total of 37 questions of mixed types. Most of the questions were single or multiple choices, numeric range choices, yes/no options, and open-ended text entries.

In addition to the microservice background and demographic information, we asked questions related to architectural concepts, infrastructure, and code management. In each question, participants had a chance to either agree or disagree with best practices identified during the interview study, or identify their solution for a particular challenge. We also asked participants to distinguish between the solution they apply in practice (what they do) and their perception (what they think they should do). [Here](survey.pdf) is pdf version of the survey.


### Survey Data 
We received a total of 148 responses; 44 of them were complete (completion rate: 29.7%) and 28 satisfied the same participant selection criteria we applied for interview study: at least two years of microservice development experience.
